<h2>Intro to R</h2>
The first line in following block of code assigns (<code>&lt;-</code>) the value 3 to the object <code>x</code>. Think of <code>x</code> as storing that value: whenever you print <code>x</code> (as the second line does), or use it in a function (as in the third line), it is replaced by the value 3.
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="intro1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- 3

</div>
<p>Note that, after you run the code, there are two lines of output below the code window. These correspond to each of the lines of code that printed something (the first line assigned but did not print anything; lines with <code>&lt;-</code> will generally not produce output, just store, or “save” it to an object).</p>
<p>If you want, you can just use R as a calculator. Whenever you create something but don’t assign it anywhere (i.e., no <code>&lt;-</code>), it will just print out the result. Try multiplying 283 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 598 in the box below:</p>

</div>
<p>Did you get 169,234? You can do all the normal stuff you’d expect to do with a calculator. Some examples are below, but feel free to play around. Notice first that there are “comments” on several of the lines of code. Everything that follows a <code>#</code> sign is not evaluated by R, so you can use comments to explain what your code does or why you’re doing it.</p>

</div>
<p>The above examples were all printed out directly, but we could also assign them to objects, as well as perform functions with them. Objects have case-sensitive names and have certain restrictions like not starting with a number, but other than that, you can basically name things whatever you want. Try to be reasonable, though – you want your code to be readable and logical. (For more good R practices, check out this <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">style guide</a>. You are by no means required to follow it to the letter, but it is always helpful to see how other people format their code.)</p>
Can you figure out what value the object <code>grape</code> holds? Write a 4th line of code to print the object and see if you are right.

Sometimes you’ll accidentally do things that are not allowed in R. In this case, you’ll get an error message. Some messages are more helpful than others; if you can’t figure out what an error message is trying to tell you, it’s often helpful to just copy and paste into Google, because chances are someone has had a similar error. Run these lines of code to see the error messages you get (and start to get used to connecting the unhelpful language with the type of problem that produced such an error).

<div id="section-quick-math-review" class="section level4">
<h4>Quick math review</h4>
<p>We saw above that we can use R to do math … but you need some mathematical intuition as well! One of the most important mathematical concepts to be familiar with for the purposes of PHS 2000 is how exponents and logarithms relate and the ways in which they can be manipulated.</p>
<p>Most of the time in probability and statistics, we use the natural logarithm <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span>, which we often write as <span class="math inline">\(\log(x)\)</span>, and the natural exponential function <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span>, which we also write as <span class="math inline">\(\exp(x)\)</span>. Recall that these are inverse functions: <span class="math display">\[\exp(x) = y \iff x = \log(y)\]</span> so if one side of an equation is exponentiated, we can always “get out of it” by applying a logarithm to both sides, and vice versa.</p>
<p>When we have a sum inside an exponent, we can decompose this into the product of two exponents: <span class="math display">\[\exp(a + b) = \exp(a)\exp(b)\]</span> Similarly, a product inside a logarithm can be written as a sum of logs: <span class="math display">\[\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)\]</span> Of course, the same is true of the inverses of addition and multiplication, subtraction and division: <span class="math display">\[\exp(a - b) = \frac{\exp(a)}{\exp(b)}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)\]</span> If we look at these functions on a graph, we can gain some intuition for a few important values you should know. <img src="index_files/figure-html/expGraph-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\to-\infty} \exp(x) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\to\infty} \exp(x) = \infty\)</span>. Somewhere in between, we have that <span class="math inline">\(\exp(0) = 1\)</span>. This is useful to know since probabilities can only take on values between 0 and 1, so exponentiating a negative number will give you such a value. It is also important to remember that exponentiating something can <em>only</em> give you a positive number (so check your work if that’s not what you get!).</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/logGraph-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Because of the inverse relationship of these functions, you can only “log” a positive number. Something like <span class="math inline">\(\log(-1)\)</span> is undefined. We can see that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x \to 0}\log(x) = -\infty\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\log(x)\)</span> increases in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> much more slowly than <span class="math inline">\(\exp(x)\)</span>. Importantly, <span class="math inline">\(\log(1) = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\log(x)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> between 0 and 1 will give you a negative number.</p>
<p>You already confirmed above in R that <span class="math inline">\(\log(1) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\exp(0) = 1\)</span>. Let’s see what we get when we reach the limits of those functions, or when we try to log something outside of its domain. In R, <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> is represented by <code>Inf</code>, and you can actually use it in functions. It will also be what’s returned to you as soon as a number is “too big”, even if it’s not actually infinite. Until you reach that point, very large (and very small) numbers are represented with scientific notation, so <span class="math inline">\(\exp(700) = 1.01 \times 10^{304}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-700) = 9.86 \times 10^{-305}\)</span>, as you can see when you run the code below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="inf" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="4">
<pre class="text"><code>exp(-Inf)
exp(700)

</div>
If you try to do something that is undefined, like take the log of a negative number, you get <code>NaN</code>, which stands for “not a number.” Interestingly, according to R, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> is not a number but <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{0}\)</span> is infinite, because R is actually returning limits when it returns <code>Inf</code> and <code>-Inf</code>, which is why we can also evaluate something like <span class="math inline">\(\exp(\infty)\)</span>.

<h2>Why and how</h2>
<div id="section-why-probability-and-statistics" class="section level4">
<h4>Why probability and statistics?</h4>
<p>You will learn a wide variety of quantitative methods in PHS 2000 from several different fields, which we hope you will find useful in your research. The common backbone to these is probability and statistics. A strong foundation in these concepts is essential for understanding the motivations and implementation of these methods and for seeing how they relate.</p>
<p>In this tutorial and throughout the course you’ll notice that we attempt to represent as much as possible in mathematical notation. As with any other language, mastering this notation helps you communicate efficiently and precisely. However, there’s no unified language – either in English or notation – across disciplines, and the differences and inconsistencies can be frustrating. One goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to notation and to formalize some concepts you may already be familiar with, in order to minimize this frustration. Representing methods in mathematical notation can be helpful in making connections to theory and to implementation in code, and it can also help both you and the PHS 2000 teaching team see what you do and don’t understand.</p>
<p>If you have taken several statistics courses before, you may be familiar with most or all of the concepts we go through in this tutorial. We nevertheless recommend that you at least read through it so that you have an understanding of what <em>we</em> expect you to be familiar with and to make sure you didn’t miss anything in your previous courses. If you’re not as comfortable with statistics or R or both, take notes as you go along that you can refer back to later. We hope for all of you that this can be a resource that you return to when you encounter difficulties over the course of the next year.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-why-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Why R?</h4>
<p>There are several great options for statistical software out there, and you may already have mastered one or more of them. In fact, it’s beneficial for you and your career to be fluent in as many different languages as possible. We have chosen R to use in this class for several reasons. First of all, it’s free. You can install it on any and all of the computers you work on. You don’t have to go to the computer lab or use a virtual desktop, and you’ll never have to buy or renew a license. Second, it’s extendable and flexible. This means other people have already written <em>packages</em> which contain sets of <em>functions</em> that implement a number of common and less common statistical methods. If there’s not a package out there that does exactly what you’re looking to do, you can write your own functions to do it. We’ll see over the course of this year that the ability to write our own own code to implement the methods we learn, as well as simulations to test those methods, is a huge help in understanding the theory behind them.</p>
<p>R is extremely flexible and has a number of capabilities that go beyond statistics. In particular, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> documents can be used to make your research reproducible as well as prepare a number of different types of reports, presentations, and more. In fact, this entire tutorial was written using the <code>learnr</code> package in R Markdown.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-to-use-this-tutorial" class="section level4">
<h4>How to use this tutorial</h4>
<p>For this tutorial, you don’t need to install anything. All the coding takes place within windows on this website itself. At some point before class starts you’ll need to install R and its useful companion RStudio if you haven’t already. For help with that you can visit <a href="https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-00-setup/">this other tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>To use the code windows on this website, simply type in the code you want to evaluate and then click “Run Code”. (Instead of clicking the button you can also press <code>control+enter</code> on a PC or <code>command+enter</code> on a Mac while your cursor is in the box.) Some boxes already have code that you just need to run (or which has already been run for you), others will require you to add to or modify what’s there, and some are empty and ready for you to fill. They generally only have as much space as you need for a given problem, but will also scroll so you can fill with as many lines of code as necessary (if your code disappears, make sure you haven’t scrolled and hidden it, or try clicking the Start Over button).</p>
<p>It may be helpful to install RStudio now and keep an open R document where you keep track of the code you learn in this tutorial and your own notes. If you want to practice changing the code and running it, it may also be easier to do there than in the code boxes here. Note that the objects you create are not generally available in later code boxes in the tutorial, so if you want more practice you should recreate what you do in a separate R session.</p>
<p>The sections have questions and R exercises designed to check your understanding, either interspersed in the text or in a section at the end labeled <em>Practice</em>. Think of these as a way to test your knowledge and decide for yourself whether you’re ready to move on. None of the questions are graded (and we can’t access your results anyway), you get as many tries as you want, and the solutions (and sometimes hints) are available. (If you only see a hint button, the solution is the last available hint.) You can easily copy and paste the solutions, but we suggest that you type them in yourself instead, as it’s better practice.</p>
<p>If you don’t feel ready to move on, you may want to check out the extra resources links (most of which are videos and practice at Khan Academy) at the bottom of most sections, or the glossary if you’re confused by the terminology. R resources are all lumped together in the final section and we highly recommend checking them out to advance your learning, either during or after you’ve completed this tutorial.</p>
<p>If you come across any errors or have technical difficulties, please notify Louisa, a former PHS 2000 student and Teaching Fellow, at <a href="mailto:louisa_h_smith@g.harvard.edu">louisa_h_smith@g.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

Let’s examine what just happened. One way we can create a vector is to “concatenate” values of the same class together using the function <code>c()</code>. This will be one of your most-used functions. Try creating the vector <code>932, 283, 194</code>:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors7" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<pre class="r"><code>c(932, 283, 194)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 932 283 194</code></pre>
<p>Just like we did with a vector of length 1, if we want to “save” values instead of just printing them out, we can assign vectors of all sizes to an object. We can also check what type of vector we created using the <code>class()</code> function:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors7b" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<pre class="text"><code>obj &lt;- c(4, 29, 40, 9384, 584)
class(obj)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can get numbers in a sequence by putting a <code>:</code> between the first and last number that we want. So to get the vector <code>100, 101, 102</code> we would write <code>100:102</code>.</p>
See if you can figure out how to create the vector <code>49, 48, 47</code>:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors8" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<pre class="r"><code>49:47</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 49 48 47</code></pre>
<p>If we want to count by something other than ones, we can use the <code>seq()</code> function. Much like the <code>:</code> function, it creates a sequence of numbers. Its first argument is the value to start with, the second the value to end with, and then you can choose an option for how to get from one to the other. The <code>by</code> argument specifies how many to count by: <code>seq(0, 100, by = 10)</code> will count from 0 to 100 by 10s. The <code>length.out</code> argument specifies how long we want the resulting vector to be. So if we want to split 32 to 212 into 101 equal values, we would write <code>seq(32, 212, length.out = 101)</code>.</p>
Try running each of those functions below:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors8b" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
Next, using the <code>seq()</code> function, create the vector <code>2, 4, 6, 8</code> and assign it to <code>x</code>, then create the vector <code>2, 5, 8</code> and assign it to <code>y</code>. Use the <code>by</code> argument first and the <code>length.out</code> argument next. Before assigning the vectors you may want to just print them out to make sure your code is doing what you expect.
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors9" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- seq(2, 8, by = 2)
y &lt;- seq(2, 8, length.out = 3)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rep()</code> function just repeats whatever its first argument is. The second argument specifies how many times to repeat it. So if we had an object called <code>x</code>, and we wanted to repeat it 3 times, we would write <code>rep(x, times = 3)</code>. Note that <code>x</code> itself could be any length. So if we wanted <code>11, 8, 11, 8</code> we could write <code>rep(c(11, 8), times = 2)</code>. On the other hand, suppose we wanted <code>11, 11, 8, 8</code>. In that case, we use the argument <code>each</code> to specify how many times we want each element of the vector repeated: <code>rep(c(11, 8), each = 2)</code>.</p>
Create the vector <code>"hello", "hello", "hello"</code> using the <code>rep()</code> function:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectors10" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<pre class="r"><code>rep(&quot;hello&quot;, times = 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;hello&quot; &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-character-vectors" class="section level4">
<h4>Character vectors</h4>
<p>As you saw just above, we can also have vectors that are not numeric. The vector you created above is an example of the <em>character</em> class. Here’s another:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="characters" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>c(&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>You can do a lot with character strings in R, but for our purposes right now they are not super useful because we can’t do math with them. Try adding “dog” + “cat”.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="charactersa" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div id="section-charactersa-hint">
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You should get the error “non-numeric argument to binary operator”.</p>
</div>
Be careful not to get confused with the name of an object and an object of class “character”. This is something totally different. Here we’re back in the land of numeric vectors:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="charactersa2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="3">
<pre class="text"><code>dog &lt;- 3
cat &lt;- 7
dog + cat</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
And here’s an example where the name of the object and what it contains are the same word:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="charactersa3" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>word &lt;- &quot;word&quot;</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-logical-vectors" class="section level4">
<h4>Logical vectors</h4>
We can also have <em>logical</em> vectors. There are only two values to this class: <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>, which must be capitalized (they may also be abbreviated <code>T</code> and <code>F</code>, though this is technically not a best practice).
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="lgoicals0" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>c(TRUE, FALSE)</code></pre>

</div>
These pop up whenever we want to evaluate a logical statement. Run the code below, then play around with switching the true statements to false and vice versa.
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="logicals1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>3 &lt; 5

</div>
Note the double equals sign in the last statement – you have to use two when checking whether two objects or values are equal (otherwise R will try to <em>assign</em> them to be equal; try running the code below).
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="logicals2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">

Play around with these logical vectors:

</div>
<p>Instead of a double equals sign in the last one, we have <code>!=</code>. This stands for “not equals”, or <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span>. We can also evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> statements with <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>.</p>
The most important thing for you to know about logical values is that <code>FALSE</code> takes on the value of 0 and <code>TRUE</code> takes on the value of 1, so unlike characters, you <em>can</em> do math with them. Guess what each of these will print before running the code.

<h2>Some probability rules</h2>
<p>It’s important to be familiar with some basic concepts in probability to understand how statistics works and get the most of out PHS 2000. We’ll keep developing skills in R as we start to learn (or review, for some of you) some of these basics in probability and statistics. Some of these ideas will be reiterated in the course, so come back to this tutorial as you encounter them for a quick review.</p>
<div id="section-frequency-definition-of-probability" class="section level4">
<h4>Frequency definition of probability</h4>
<p>If an experiment is repeated <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times under identical conditions, and some event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurs <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times, we can define the probability of that event <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> as the proportion of times the event occurs as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> approaches infinity: <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{m}{n}\]</span> For example, imagine a coin is flipped <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denote the event that ‘tails’ is face up. <span class="math display">\[P(T) = \lim_{\# flips \to \infty} \frac{\#\text{ of tails}}{\#\text{ of flips}}\]</span></p>
<p>We know the probability of flipping ‘tails’ with a fair coin is 0.5, but if we flip a coin a <em>finite</em> number of times, we probably won’t get ‘tails’ exactly half the time. Let’s see how close we get, though. Instead of a real coin, we’ll use R to simulate flipping a coin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times.</p>
<p>First, we’ll start with some number for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, let’s say 100. We’ll assign this value to an object <code>n</code> so that we can reuse it later – and when we increase <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> toward infinity, we won’t need to replace it everywhere. We’ll also need a coin with the appropriate sides, ‘heads’ and ‘tails’.</p>
<p>Create an object <code>n</code> that is a numeric vector of length 1 with a value of <code>100</code> and another object <code>coin</code> that is a character vector <code>"heads", "tails"</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="prep-coin" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<p>Now we need another function to help “flip” the coin. We’ll use the function <code>sample()</code>, which takes a random sample from a given vector. Functions take “arguments” as input. If you don’t know or have forgotten what arguments a function requires, or what it uses as default values if you don’t supply it with anything, you can type <code>?</code> and the function name to bring up the help file.

<p>The sample function takes the arguments <code>x =</code>, <code>size =</code>, <code>replace =</code>, and <code>prob =</code>. Both of the final two have default values (<code>FALSE</code> and <code>NULL</code>, respectively), so we don’t need to specify anything in particular if we are happy with those. The help file gives lots of details about what kinds of values or objects each argument can take, as well as a description of what the function does and useful references and examples.</p>
<p>Returning to our experiment, we’ll give the <code>sample()</code> function the <code>coin</code> vector we created and tell it to sample <code>size = n</code> times. We also need the <code>replace = TRUE</code> argument, which means that it can sample the same value more than once (Or else you’d be limited to 2 flips, a ‘heads’ and a ‘tails’! Try replacing the <code>TRUE</code> with <code>FALSE</code> to see what happens.).</p>

The <code>flips</code> object is a character vector of length 100. Here are two useful functions you can use to examine it a little more closely. <code>length()</code> gives you the number of elements in a vector, and <code>head()</code> lets you look at the first 6 elements (very useful when you have a big object and don’t want to print out the whole thing; you can also use <code>tail()</code> to look at the last 6).

<p>Now we need an easy way to figure out what fraction of the flips are ‘tails’. We already have the denominator, <em>n</em>, we just need <em>m</em>, the number of ‘tails’. Recall that we can check whether things are equal using <code>==</code>. Imagine that the <code>flips</code> vector only contains two elements: <code>"heads", "tails"</code>. If we run <code>flips == "tails"</code> with that object, we’ll get a logical vector of the same length: <code>FALSE, TRUE</code>.</p>
Before continuing with the experiment, play around with this code to see how this and similar examples work:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="coin4" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) == &quot;tails&quot;
c(53, 19, 392) == 19 # which elements (if any) equal 19?
1:5 &gt; 2 # which integers from 1 to 5 are greater than ?</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Use <code>==</code> with our original <code>flips</code> object to create a logical vector indicating which elements are ‘tails’. Assign this to an object <code>flips_tails</code>. Use the <code>length()</code> and <code>head()</code> functions to explore that object.</p>

<p>Finally we need to count the number of <code>TRUE</code> elements in our <code>flips_tails</code> object. Recall that we can perform mathematical functions on logical values, and <code>TRUE</code> = 1. To count the number of <code>TRUE</code>s, we can just sum over the entire <code>flips_tails</code> vector, since <code>FALSE</code> = 0. We can do that with the <code>sum()</code> function.</p>

<h4>Another experiment</h4>
<p>We have 3 balls in a cup, one blue, one red, one green.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> denote the event that such a color ball is chosen, respectively.</p>
<p>These events are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>: if you picked blue, you didn’t pick red or green. This idea is illustrated by this diagram in which none of the events overlap. <img src="index_files/figure-html/balls-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can also describe this situation by writing <span class="math display">\[P(B \cap R) = 0\]</span> <span class="math display">\[P(R \cap G) = 0\]</span> <span class="math display">\[P(B \cap G) = 0\]</span> This tells us you can’t pick both at once (the probability of doing so is 0): the events <strong>don’t intersect</strong>. The <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> symbol refers to the intersection of those events – whether they “overlap”, or both events could happen at the same time.</p>
<p>So what do we know about <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>? Well, there’s no possibility of picking <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> <em>and</em> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. However, we might pick <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> <em>or</em> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (i.e., something besides <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>)!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(B \cup R) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\#\text{blue }or\text{ red balls}}{n}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(B \cup R\)</span> is the <strong>union</strong> of the two events – whether <em>at least</em> one of the events occurs.</p>
<p>Whenever two events are mutually exclusive, we can just add their individual probabilities to get the overall probability of either one of them. So we can write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(B \cup R) = P(B) + P(R)\]</span></p>
<p>In English, we can read this as “the probability of choosing a blue <em>or</em> a red ball is equal to the sum of the probability of choosing a blue ball and that of choosing a red ball.”</p>
<p>See if you can understand what’s going on in this code based on the code for the coin experiment we worked on above. (Some steps have been condensed compared to the coin example; in other words, the intermediate objects weren’t stored, but used directly in functions.)</p>

<h4>Flipping multiple coins</h4>
<p>What if our events aren’t mutually exclusive? Let’s return to a coin flipping experiment, but imagine this time that the experiment is to flip 2 coins.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> denote the event that the <em>first</em> coin is a ‘heads’.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> denote the event that the <em>second</em> coin is a ‘tails’.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are four possible outcomes of the experiment: ‘heads’ &amp; ‘heads’; ‘heads’ &amp; ‘tails’; ‘tails’ &amp; ‘heads’; and ‘tails’ &amp; ‘tails’. The first event of interest, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, occurs in the first two outcomes, and <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> occurs in the second and fourth. The fact that the diagram below (not to scale) has an overlapping area depicts the fact that there exists an outcome (‘heads’ &amp; ‘tails’) in which both events occur – their intersection.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/2coins-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Now they are no longer mutually exclusive: <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \cap T_2) \neq 0\)</span>. If we want to know the probability of their union – that is, <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \cup T_2)\)</span>, the probability that we get a ‘heads’ first <em>or</em> a ‘tails’ second, we can no longer just add the individual probabilities.</p>
<p>In fact, <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1) = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T_2) = 0.5\)</span> (we’re still assuming fair coins), so if we just added the probabilities together, we would have a probability of 1, which doesn’t make sense – it would imply that every single time we flipped two coins, the first would be guaranteed to be a ‘heads’ <em>or</em> the second would be ‘tails’ (i.e., the ‘tails’ &amp; ‘heads’ outcome doesn’t exist). This is an overestimate of the probability of the union because <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1)\)</span> includes all those times we <em>also</em> get ‘tails’ next, and <span class="math inline">\(P(T_2)\)</span> includes all those times we <em>also</em> got ‘heads’ first (the overlapping area in the diagram) – but those two situations are exactly the same outcome, so we are double-counting all the times we get ‘heads’ &amp; ‘tails’.</p>
<p>We have to subtract off the doubly-counted intersection: <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \cup T_2) = P(H_1) + P(T_2) - P(H_1 \cap T_2).\)</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \cap T_2) = 0.25\)</span> (it occurs in <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the possible outcomes), <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \cup T_2) = 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.75\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that this formula also applies to the case where the events are mutually exclusive, as in our example with the balls. In that case, the last term is just 0, which is why we could write the simpler expression <span class="math inline">\(P(B \cup R) = P(B) + P(R)\)</span> above.</p>

<div id="section-independence-briefly" class="section level4">
<h4>Independence, briefly</h4>
<p>To recap, to find the probability of either one of two events (their <em>union</em>), we can add their individual probabilities, but if they both can happen at once (they’re not <em>mutually exclusive</em>) we need to subtract off the probability that they both happen (their <em>intersection</em>).</p>
<p>But how do we find the probability that they both happen? It depends on whether the events are <strong>independent</strong>. Independence essentially means that knowing whether one event happened doesn’t give you any information about another event. In our coins experiment, knowing that one coin landed on ‘heads’ tells you nothing about whether the next coin will be ‘heads’ or ‘tails’. (In fact, believing that it does will lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler&#39;s_fallacy">gambler’s fallacy</a>!)</p>
<p>If two events are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities to get the probability of their intersection: <span class="math display">\[P(H \cap T) = P(H) \times P(T)\]</span></p>
<p>In English, this says that the probability that we get a ‘heads’ first and then a ‘tails’ is the product of their individual probabilities. We can easily see that <span class="math inline">\(P(H \cap T) = \frac{1}{4}\)</span> because the events occur simultaneously in one of the four possible outcomes, but we also could come to the same conclusion by multiplying the probability of a <code>heads</code> on the first flip by the probability of a <code>tails</code> on the second flip: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We’ll see the idea of independence show up in more detail later in this tutorial, and again and again in the course, but remember that we can only multiply the overall probabilities like this <em>if</em> events are independent.</p>

<div id="section-discrete-random-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Discrete random variables</h2>
<p>So far we’ve looked at the probability of a given event or combination of events that result from an experiment. Now we’ll learn how to characterize the probabilities of <em>all</em> the possible outcomes of an experiment: its <strong>probability distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s first talk about those possible outcomes. We can assign them numeric values. For example, when we flip a coin once we have two possible outcomes: ‘heads’ (which we’ll assign the value 1) and ‘tails’ (0). Because the value (1 or 0) that we observe comes from some random process (a coin flip), we call it a <strong>random variable</strong>.</p>
<p>A random variable is the <em>numerical outcome of some random event</em>. That may sound a bit obtuse, but we’ll see plenty of examples here and throughout the course. We generally use capital letters to denote random variables and lower case letters to denote their <strong>realizations</strong>, or the values that they take on.</p>
<p>Consider the following characterization of the coin flip:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(X = x) = \begin{cases} 
      0.5 &amp; \text{for } x =  0 \\
      0.5 &amp; \text{for } x =  1 \\
   \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>The random variable that represents the outcome of the coin flip experiment is <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. It can take on two possible values: <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> (‘tails’) and <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> (‘heads’). Each of them has equal probability of occurring (if it were an unfair coin, we could assign probabilities other than 0.5).</p>
<div id="section-probability-mass-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Probability mass functions</h4>
<p>The function above is called a <strong>probability mass function</strong> (pmf). For a <strong>discrete</strong> random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, its pmf, often denoted <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, is the function that describes the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes on each of its possible values: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = P(X = x)\]</span></p>
<p>The fact that the random variable has a <strong>discrete</strong> probability distribution means that it has a countable number of possible values (we’ll contrast this later with <strong>continuous</strong> distributions.)</p>
<p>For some distributions we may be able to enumerate those possible values. For example, for an experiment with possible outcomes <span class="math inline">\({0, 1, 2}\)</span>, we may have that: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      0.1 &amp; \text{for } x =  0 \\
      0.5 &amp; \text{for } x =  1 \\
      0.4 &amp; \text{for } x =  2 \\
   \end{cases}
\]</span> (We’ll leave implicit the fact that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span> for all other values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.) This describes a discrete probability distribution: <img src="index_files/figure-html/pmf1-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In other cases, we may have a single expression that produces those values. For example, the <strong>Poisson distribution</strong> can take on any integer value from 0 to infinity. Its pmf, which depends on the rate parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (a constant value, like 1.5 or 50, that helps define a distribution) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots\)</span>. The pmf for the Poisson(2) distribution (we generally put the parameters of a distribution in parentheses following its name, so Poisson(2) means that its rate parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\)</span>) looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/pmf2-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> though of course the x-axis could continue to infinity, if there were space on your computer screen. It’s pretty pointless to extend it further, though, because the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span> of any given value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> greater than those shown is very close to 0.</p>
<p>Graphing these pmfs shows us that they have some similarities. In fact, all pmfs (remember, pmfs are for <strong>discrete</strong> distributions only), follow certain rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The probabilities over all the possible values must sum to 1</p></li>
<li><p>None of the probabilities can be &lt; 0 or &gt; 1</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="section-probability-distributions-in-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Probability distributions in R</h4>
<p>Now let’s learn some new R functions in order to help us explore discrete probability distributions and their pmfs.</p>
<p>There is a family of functions for each of many distributions, including the <strong>binomial</strong> (the coin flip experiment was a special case of this called the <strong>Bernoulli</strong>) and the <strong>Poisson</strong> (the Poisson is often used for counts, such as cases of disease).</p>
<p>Each of these distributions has a ‘shortcut’ or abbreviation in R. For example, binomial is <code>binom</code> and Poisson is <code>pois</code>. Some other shortcuts for discrete distributions include <code>geom</code> for the geometric distribution and <code>nbinom</code> for the negative binomial (you don’t have to know these).</p>
<p>To get the pmf for a given distribution at a given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value, you simply attach the prefix <code>d</code> to the shortcut. The function may require that you specify other parameters of the distribution, like we did with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\)</span> in the Poisson above. The parameter associated with the Bernoulli (coin flip) distribution is sometimes denoted <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, other times <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, but in any case it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 1)\)</span>. In R, those arguments are <code>lambda =</code> and <code>prob =</code>, respectively.</p>
To demonstrate this, let’s recreate the pmf from the coin flip experiment. We need the two possible <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> values, 0 and 1:
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="dbinom-prep" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- c(0, 1)</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="dbinom1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- c(0, 1)</code></pre>

</div>
as well as the <code>dbinom</code> command (which also takes the <code>size =</code> argument: <code>size = 1</code> means we’re working with 1 coin, which is the Bernoulli distribution):
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="dbinom2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<pre class="text"><code>fx &lt;- dbinom(x, size = 1, prob = 0.5)

</div>
<p>That looks like the function we saw above! This is the Bernoulli(0.5) distribution.</p>
<p>Now look at the Poisson(2) distribution (again, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\)</span>). We’ll look just at values through 15.</p>
First create the <code>x</code> object with the possible values of the Poisson distribution (again, just 0 through 15). Then create the <code>fx</code> object using the appropriate function (you will need the argument <code>lambda = 2</code>). Print out the values and see whether they match the graph from earlier (just eyeball them).

cbind(x, fx)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now look at some graphs of pmfs as you change the distributions and the parameters. You will use the <code>pmf_func()</code> function (which was created for this tutorial and is not included with R, so you won’t be able to use it outside the tutorial), which takes arguments <code>x =</code> and <code>fx =</code>, like you created earlier. I’ve started you off with one pmf; play around with the first two lines of the code to create new graphs. (You may want to look up the distributions on Wikipedia to get an idea of what values they can take on and what the parameters mean; the pages have very helpful sidebars. You can also find the help files for each distribution <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Distributions.html">here</a>, which will help you figure out the shortcuts and know which extra arguments (like <code>prob</code> or <code>lambda</code>) the functions require.)</p>

<div id="section-cumulative-distribution-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Cumulative distribution functions</h2>
<p>Another way we can characterize probability distributions is via their <strong>cumulative distribution functions</strong> (cdfs). While only <strong>discrete</strong> distributions have pmfs (later we’ll see what <strong>continuous</strong> distributions have instead), both discrete and continuous distributions have cdfs, defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(x) = P(X \leq x)\]</span></p>
<p>Returning to our example of the fair coin, we can plug in the two values that the random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can take on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(F(0) = P(X \leq 0) = 0.5\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(F(1) = P(X \leq 1) = 1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We could in fact plug in any value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: the cdf of a <strong>discrete</strong> distribution is a step function with jumps at each of its possible realizations:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/cdf-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This may seem kind of strange. It is essentially just telling us that the probability of a ‘tails’ (<span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq 0)\)</span>, since ‘tails’ is 0) is 0.5 and the probability of a ‘heads’ <em>or</em> a ‘tails’ (<span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq 1)\)</span>) is 1. The probability of neither ‘heads’ nor ‘tails’ (<span class="math inline">\(P(X &lt; 0)\)</span>) is of course 0. We aren’t getting any new information from a cdf that we couldn’t get from a pmf – we’ll see directly how they relate later – but it turns out that cdfs are very useful.</p>
<p>Just like pmfs, cdfs follow certain rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\(- \infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F(x) = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F(x) = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> is non-decreasing (it never gets smaller as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> increases)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Confirm that the graph above adheres to these rules. Then think about how these rules connect to those we saw for pmfs (we’ll look at the connection more explicitly later).</p>
<p>We know that no probability <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span> can be less than 0 or greater than 1; we also know that the total probability over all values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> must equal 1 exactly. The fact that the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span> can’t be negative tells us why the cdf must be non-decreasing – we can never decrease in cumulative probability when moving from left to right along the x-axis of the cdf. This also explains why the lower limit is 0. The upper limit must be 1 because the total probability <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq x)\)</span> must be 1 at its most extreme value (possibly approaching <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, though for the fair coin the largest possible value the random variable can take is only 1).</p>
<div id="section-another-example" class="section level4">
<h4>Another example</h4>
We briefly looked at a distribution defined by <span class="math display">\[f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      0.1 &amp; \text{for } x =  0 \\
      0.5 &amp; \text{for } x =  1 \\
      0.4 &amp; \text{for } x =  2 \\
   \end{cases}
\]</span> What does <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> look like? (Like <code>pdf_func()</code>, <code>cdf_func()</code> is a special function for this tutorial that you won’t find in base R. It takes the same arguments as <code>pdf_func()</code>, that is, the values <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span> from the pmf.)
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="cdfPractice" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="3">

<p>Try replacing the values above with those from other pdfs we’ve looked at (you’ll need to change both <code>x</code> and <code>fx</code>, and make sure they’re the same length). Confirm that they meet the above criteria. Then try the ones you considered in last section’s multiple choice question that didn’t correspond with true probability distributions, and see that they don’t follow the rules.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-lots-of-coins" class="section level4">
<h4>Lots of coins</h4>
<p>Now let’s look at an example in which a cdf may be particularly useful. Instead of flipping one coin, imagine we are flipping ten coins and counting the number of ‘heads’ (this is the binomial distribution with parameter <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span>, or <code>size = 10</code> in R language). Again we’ll call this random variable (the total number of ‘heads’ in ten flips) <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="numHeads" class="tutorial-question panel-body">

<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you pay $5 to enter the game, your friend agrees to pay you $1 for every ‘heads’ you flip (you trust that your friend is playing with a fair coin). You want to know what the chances are that you’ll lose money on the game, that is, that you’ll get a value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that’s less than 5.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="loseMoney" class="tutorial-question panel-body">

<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cdf is useful here because we want to know the probability of a set of outcomes: in this case, the outcomes <span class="math inline">\(X = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(X = 5\)</span>, we come out even, and if <span class="math inline">\(X &gt; 5\)</span>, we come out ahead.</p>
<p>In order to calculate this probability, we need to know <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 2)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 3)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 4)\)</span>. Only one of these things can happen in a given game – they are mutually exclusive – so we can just add their probabilities to find the probability that <em>any</em> one of them happens. <span class="math display">\[P(X \leq 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\]</span> We could also write this <span class="math display">\[P(X \leq 4) = \sum_{x = 0}^4 P(X = x)\]</span> This tells us the relationship between the pmf and the cdf. For a discrete random variable which can take on a minimum value of 0, as in our scenario and many other distributions, <span class="math inline">\(F(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^x f(i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we look at a graph of the cdf for our coin game, we can see what’s going on. At each jump (from an open circle to a closed circle), we are simply adding <span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, for that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/index-1-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> We can see from the graph that we have less than 40% chance of losing money by playing the game. Maybe you’re willing to take that risk, maybe you’re not. Or maybe you can look at the cdf and decide to negotiate with your friend to pay only $4 to enter, which would just about halve your chances of losing out.</p>

<h4>Cumulative distribution functions in R</h4>
<p>In the last section we saw that there is a class of functions in R that begin with <code>d</code>, followed by an abbreviation for the name of a probability distribution. We used these to find values from the pmfs for those distributions. Now will see that the functions for cdfs operate similarly, only these begin with <code>p</code>.</p>
The first two lines are from the last section; the third shows how to change the code (very slightly!) to get the cdf. Add a final line using the <code>cbind()</code> function to print out the <code>x</code> and <code>Fx</code> values to confirm they match what we have for the cdf above.

<p>Like we said earlier, the coin game in the last example fits the <strong>binomial</strong> probability distribution. The binomial distribution is just the sum of independent Bernoulli trials, or individual coin flips. When we previously used the <code>binom</code> functions, we used the argument <code>size = 1</code> because we were only flipping one coin. To fit our example, we would use the argument <code>size = 10</code>. Use the code box below to figure out the exact probability that you would lose money (remember that it should be a bit less than 0.4, based on our eyeballing of the graph above). Then sum across the appropriate values of the pmf to make sure you get the same answer, to show yourself that the cdf and the pdf give you the same information.</p>

<h2>Marginal vs. conditional</h2>
<p>Let’s move away from coins and balls and start thinking in terms of examples that are more similar to those that may appear in your work.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D \in \{0, 1\}\)</span> denote the absence or presence of disease in some individual. This means that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a random variable with two possible values (0 and 1), meaning that it must have a <strong>discrete</strong> distribution. In particular, the only possible distribution a binary variable like <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> can have is <strong>Bernoulli</strong> (just like the coin flip!).</p>
<p>(If you aren’t really feeling this idea that disease is a <em>random</em> flip of a coin, know that we will be of course looking at factors that explain the probability of disease or other outcomes, but we assume that even once we’ve accounted for these factors of interest, there is some randomness left over that we can’t or don’t attempt to explain.)</p>
<p>Imagine that we are looking at a population in which the disease is pretty common: any given individual has a 30% chance of having it. This means we can define the probability mass function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(d) = \begin{cases} 
      0.7 &amp; \text{for } d =  0 \\
      0.3 &amp; \text{for } d =  1 \\

<p>or, because this is a Bernoulli random variable, we saw we could write the pmf <span class="math inline">\(f(d) = 0.3^d0.7^{1 - d}\)</span>. Before moving on, think about how you would write out the cumulative distribution function.</p>
<div id="section-a-second-random-variable" class="section level4">
<h4>A second random variable</h4>
<p>Now let’s imagine we have a test to detect the presence of the disease (but, like most tests, it’s not completely accurate). We’ll say <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the random variable, also Bernoulli distributed, where a value of 1 indicates that an individual tests positive and 0 indicates a negative test.</p>
<p>Let’s try to describe the probability that an individual tests positive for the disease: <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span>. What information might you have that could affect how you describe this probability?</p>
<p>Do you think the probability of testing positive, <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span> has anything to do with the probability of actually having the disease, <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1)\)</span>?</p>
<p>We hope so, or else the test is pretty worthless! These random variables are <strong>not independent</strong>. We saw before that independence means that information about one event doesn’t tell you anything about another event. But in this situation, testing positive tells you something about whether an individual has the disease – that they are more likely to have it than if they tested negative.</p>
<p>Recall that two events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are said to be independent if <span class="math display">\[P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)\]</span></p>
<p>If this were the case for our disease example, we could find the probability that someone both has disease and tests positive simply by multiplying the <strong>marginal</strong> probability of the disease by the <strong>marginal</strong> probability of testing positive: <span class="math display">\[P(D = 1, T = 1) = P(D = 1) \times P(T = 1)\]</span></p>
<p>(We refer to probability of the intersection of two events <span class="math inline">\((D = 1) \cap (T = 1)\)</span> as their <strong>joint probability</strong>, and we can separate the two with a comma instead of using the <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> symbol.)</p>
<p>This equality would only hold if whether you test positive has nothing to do with whether you have disease – if it’s constant no matter what.</p>

<div id="section-marginal-vs.-conditional-probabilities" class="section level4">
<h4>Marginal vs. conditional probabilities</h4>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span> is a <strong>marginal</strong> probability: it tells us the probability of testing positive <em>overall</em> in the population, ignoring disease status. We’ve said <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.3\)</span> in this population. Will <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span> be the same in a population where <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.1\)</span>? What about if <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.7\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span> clearly depends on the distribution of disease in the population, because whether people test positive depends on whether they have the disease or not.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> can take on two values, we have two <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Read these as “the probability that <span class="math inline">\(T = 1\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(D = 1/0\)</span>”, or “conditional on <span class="math inline">\(D = 1/0\)</span>”. Instead of the overall probability in the population, these values are probabilities that only apply to a subset of the population, in this case defined by the presence or absence of disease. We would expect that <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1) &gt; P(T = 1 | D = 0)\)</span> if the test is at least somewhat effective.</p>
<p>Let’s say that <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1) = 0.9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0) = 0.2\)</span>.</p>

<p>Conditional probabilities behave like unconditional probabilities! We need the conditional probabilities (given a single condition, like <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span>) to add up to 1 over all the possible values of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 0 | D = 1)\)</span> must be 0.1, and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 0 | D = 0)\)</span> must be 0.8.</p>
<p>However, the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0)\)</span> aren’t required to relate to each other in any particular way (though we are often trying to investigate such relationships, and in this case we can make a reasonable assumption about which is greater).</p>
<p>We’ll see later how we can use all our information to calculate the <strong>marginal</strong> probability <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span>.</p>

<div id="section-tables-in-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Tables in R</h4>
<p>Let’s see how we could look at this data in R.</p>
<p>Imagine we have access to the entire population’s disease and test status. In that case, the proportion of people with disease will correspond with the probability that any randomly chosen one of them has disease. In the real world, we’ll only have access to a sample and will have to estimate these probabilities – this is why we need statistics, but we’ll get to that later.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.3\)</span>, let’s create a population in which exactly 30% of observations have <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span> and 70% <span class="math inline">\(D = 0\)</span>. Using a population size of <span class="math inline">\(n = 100\)</span>, create a vector <code>disease</code> with this data.</p>

<p>How can we confirm that <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.3\)</span> in our population? Well, the mean of a binary variable is its probability. Taking the mean of the variable in this population means summing up all the 0/1 values and dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> – this gives us the proportion that are equal to 1. We did this when we were looking at coin flips; now we’ll use the <code>mean()</code> function to shorten our code.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="diseaseProp" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">

</div>
<p>We also know that <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1) = 0.9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0) = 0.2\)</span>. I’ll provide you with the vector <code>test</code> which has the appropriate values (1s and 0s) for our population’s test status. Look at the vector to make sure it looks like what you’d expect.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="test" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">

</div>
<p>It’s not a great idea to have your data hanging out in separate individual vectors, though. We want it all in the same dataset so that we can make sure that the first person’s data is all together, as is the second person’s, etc. The type of object that we’ll use is called a “dataframe” in R (notice the function <code>data.frame()</code> has a period in it). You can combine vectors of any class into a dataframe, as long as they’re all the same length. We’ll call our data <code>dat</code> (you don’t want to use the name <code>data</code> because it’s the name of a function in R).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="dataframe" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">
<pre class="text"><code>dat &lt;- data.frame(disease, test)

</div>
<p>Again we can look at the first chunk of our data using the <code>head()</code> function, but another function is often more useful for getting an idea of what’s in a dataframe: <code>summary()</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="dataframeSum" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>summary(dat)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>This command tells us the names of our variables as well as some summary statistics about them (when we have datasets that contain non-numeric data, it will also tell us about what types of variables we have). It’s helpful to make sure everything is what you would expect and in the form you want it.</p>
<p>When we want to reference a specific variable’s values in a dataframe, we use the format <code>dataframe$variable</code>. To confirm that the data on disease status in our dataframe is the same as we started with, run the command <code>mean(dat$disease)</code> in the window below. The vector <code>disease</code> you created before is the exact same vector you get when you call <code>dat$disease</code>. You can also use other functions you know directly on that variable, such as <code>head()</code> and <code>length()</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>Now let’s confirm that <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1) = 0.9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0) = 0.2\)</span>. There are a couple of ways we can do that: tables and subsetting. Let’s start with tables.</p>
<p>The <code>table()</code> function makes a frequency table with whatever variables we include in the parentheses. Remember that since they’re in a dataframe, we need to use the <code>$</code> format to access them:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="tableDat1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>table(dat$disease)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"disease-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>When we just include one variable in the parentheses, we learn how many observations there are with each of the values of the variable. However, for our purposes, since we are looking at one variable within strata of another, we can start to get what we’re looking for by putting both variables in the parentheses:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="tableDat2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>table(dat$disease, dat$test)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"disease-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>This table would be more useful with a couple of changes. Let’s first add the marginal totals. To do that we use the function <code>addmargins()</code>, which operates on a table object (so we create the table inside the parentheses).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="tableMarg" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>addmargins(table(dat$disease, dat$test))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"disease-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
Similarly, <code>prop.table()</code> operates on a table object (so you can’t pass it the variables directly – don’t make that common mistake) and converts the values to proportions. Without extra arguments, these are calculated to sum to 1 across all the cells, but you can also use the argument <code>margin =</code> with a value of either 1 (by row) or 2 (by column) in order to calculate row or column proportions. Experiment with this function and the <code>margin =</code> argument. What code would you use to find <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0)\)</span>?
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="tableProp" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="3">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"disease-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>

<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="tableProp-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>prop.table(table(dat$disease, dat$test), margin = 1)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Tables are easy when the data are discrete, especially with only two possible values. In general, though, if we want to know something about a subset of the population (like the conditional probabilities we’ve been looking at, but also things like a conditional median or maximum value), we can subset the data directly and perform whatever function we want on that portion of the dataset.</p>
<p>The <code>subset()</code> function can take as a first argument a dataframe, and as the second (<code>subset =</code>) a logical expression that will evaluate to <code>TRUE</code> for those observations we want to keep. (It can also be used to select the variables we want to retain with the <code>select =</code> argument. Look at the help file for more details and examples.)</p>
In order to parallel the conditional probabilities we are exploring, we’ll make two new datasets, one for <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span> and the other for <span class="math inline">\(D = 0\)</span>. Then we’ll simply look again at the mean of the 0/1 <code>test</code> variable, but this time within each of the new dataframes separately.
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="subset" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="4">
<pre class="text"><code>d1 &lt;- subset(dat, subset = disease == 1)
d0 &lt;- subset(dat, subset = disease == 0)
mean(d1$test)
mean(d0$test)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"disease-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Does this match what you got before? Note that we now have three datasets hanging out in our R “environment”: the full data in <code>dat</code>, and the two subsets of the data in <code>d1</code> and <code>d0</code>. In R you can work with many datasets and objects at the same time – you just need to make sure you don’t get them mixed up!</p>

<div id="section-total-probability-and-bayes" class="section level2">
<h2>Total probability and Bayes</h2>
<p>One very important skill is manipulating conditional and marginal probabilities. Think of it like a puzzle: you have all the pieces you need, and you need to figure out how to put them together to answer the question you want.</p>
<p>We have several pieces of information from the previous section. We know that <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1) = 0.3\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 1) = 0.9\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0) = 0.2\)</span> (remember that since <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are binary variables, we also know <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 0| D = d)\)</span> as well).</p>
<p>Now, what if we want to know the marginal probability <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span>? For example, maybe we have a second test that is used after a positive first test to confirm disease. We want to know how many of these second-round tests to order, which requires knowing how many people overall will test positive in the first place.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we began with two groups of people, the diseased and non-diseased, who take up these proportions of the population: <img src="index_files/figure-html/cond1-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then, within each of the two strata, we came up with conditional probabilities for testing positive and negative. Notice that <em>within</em> the two conditioning statements (i.e., on both the left- and right-hand sides of the diagram), the probabilities sum to 1. This should let us know intuitively that we can’t add <em>across strata</em>; for example, to find <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span>, we can’t just add <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1 | D = 0) + P(T = 1 | D = 1)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/cond2-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Instead, we have to “weight” the conditional probabilities by the respective size of their strata before we can add them. The size of the strata is just <span class="math inline">\(P(D = d)\)</span>. “Weighting” by these marginal probabilities gives us <strong>joint probabilities</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (recall that the joint probability is the probability of the intersection of two values of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[P(T = t, D = d) = P(T = t | D = d)P(D = d)\]</span></p>
<p>The calculations for each combination of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are shown below. Confirm on your own that <em>these</em> values all sum to 1.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/total-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Now we can sum the joint probabilities that involve <span class="math inline">\(T = 1\)</span> over all the possible values of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to calculate the marginal probability of <span class="math inline">\(T = 1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(T = 1) &amp; = \sum_{d = 0}^1 P(T = 1, D = d) \\
&amp; = \sum_{d = 0}^1 P(T = 1 | D = d)P(D = d) \\
&amp; = 0.9 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \\
&amp; = 0.41
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Decomposing a marginal probability into the sum of conditional probabilities given another variable is called the <strong>law of total probability</strong>. Note that we could solve for the marginal probability of <span class="math inline">\(T = 1\)</span> if we knew its conditional probabilities given <em>any</em> other variable, not just disease. We can write the law of total probability generally as <span class="math display">\[P(X = x) = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}P(X = x | Y = y)P(Y = y)\]</span> where the notation <span class="math inline">\(y \in \mathcal{Y}\)</span> just means that we are summing over all the possible values that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can take on.</p>
<p>This idea of “weighting” by probabilities will come up again later, when you’ll learn about expectations, including mean and variance. You’ll also see then how the same concept comes into play with continuous random variables, where these ideas also hold.</p>
<div id="section-bayes-theorem" class="section level4">
<h4>Bayes’ theorem</h4>
<p>We saw above that we can decompose a joint probability into the product of a marginal and a conditional probability: <span class="math inline">\(P(T = t, D = d) = P(T = t | D = d)P(D = d)\)</span>. This statement told us that It turns out the same holds true even if we switch which variable is in the conditioning statement: <span class="math inline">\(P(T = t, D = d) = P(D = d | T = t)P(T = t)\)</span>. In words, we can think of this as the probability of some combination of testing and disease status being equal to the product of the probability of disease given some test result and the overall probability of that test result.</p>
<p>We can use the fact that these two probabilities are equal: <span class="math display">\[P(T = t | D = d)P(D = d) = P(D = d | T = t)P(T = t)\]</span> to come up with Bayes’ theorem: <span class="math display">\[P(T = t | D = d) = \frac{P(D = d | T = t)P(T = t)}{P(D = d)}.\]</span></p>
<p>Bayes’ theorem can be used to “switch” what we’re conditioning on in a probability. In some situations, it may be useful to know what the probability of testing positive given disease is (this is also known as sensitivity). In other situations, it may be useful to know what the probability of having disease given a positive test is (this is also known as positive predictive value). While the former may be useful while developing and comparing tests, the latter is particularly useful to a patient who has just tested positive. If we want to let this patient know how worried they should be, we can simply switch the condition: <span class="math display">\[P(D = d | T = t) = \frac{P(T = t | D = d)P(D = d)}{P(T = t)}.\]</span></p>

<p>Remembering that we can decompose the marginal probability in the denominator of Bayes’ law, we can write things more generally as: <span class="math display">\[P(Y = y | X = x) = \frac{P(X = x | Y = y)P(Y = y)}{ \sum_{y&#39; \in \mathcal{Y}}P(X = x | Y = y&#39;)P(Y = y&#39;)}\]</span> Note the notation in the denominator. To distinguish the values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in the summation from the particular value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of interest, we can denote them <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>. We do sum over that particular value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as well, though, because we are summing over <em>all</em> the possible values!</p>

<div id="section-return-to-the-r-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Return to the R data</h4>
<p>We’ll look back at the data we used in the previous section to confirm that everything we learned in this section holds true.</p>
<p>We used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, or <code>test</code> and <code>disease</code>, were binary variables and that we were interested in the proportions equal to 1 to easily find those proportions in R with the <code>mean()</code> function. However, what if we want to find the probability of testing negative in the population, <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 0)\)</span>? OK, we could easily subtract <span class="math inline">\(1 - P(T = 1)\)</span> using the code <code>1 - mean(dat$test)</code>, but when we’re looking at variables that aren’t binary, we won’t be able to do that.</p>
<p>We actually already saw the solution to this problem in the section on probability rules, but here we’ll formalize it a little. Whenever we want to turn something into a binary 0/1 variable, we can use indicator notation, which uses <span class="math inline">\(I()\)</span> to turn values that make whatever statement is in the parentheses true into 1, and anything that is false to 0. When we summed over the series of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> coin flips earlier in this tutorial using the R code <code>sum(flips == "tails")</code>, we could have written something like this: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i = 1}^n I(flip_i = heads)\]</span> Like the R code, which uses <code>==</code> to turn a statement into <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> values, which are then summed as if they have the values 1 or 0, this expression tells us to look at each of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> flips, indexed by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and evaluate whether it was heads or not: if yes, it’s equal to 1, if not, it’s 0.</p>
<p>We can therefore use the <code>mean()</code> function to find <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 0)\)</span>. We want to calculate <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n I(D = 0).\]</span> In R, we could do this as follows:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="d0" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">

</div>
There are two (actually, more!) ways to find the marginal probability that <code>test = 1</code> in the <code>dat</code> dataset: by calculating it directly, and by using the law of total probability to calculate all the component parts and sum them. Using only R commands (and no probabilities that you’ve previously been given), calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(T = 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{d = 0}^1 P(T = 1 | D = d)P(D = d)\)</span> to confirm they’re the same.

<p>We can use indicator notation with any kind of true/false statement. Let’s say we also have information on age, and we want to know if disease prevalence differs between young (&lt; 50 years old) and old (50+ years old). Age in years is now stored in the <code>dat</code> dataset in the variable <code>age</code>.

<p>Now let’s use our R and Bayes’ theorem skills to find the disease prevalence among the “old” portion of our population. We’ll denote age in years with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, so that we can write the probability we’re looking for: <span class="math display">\[P(D = 1 | A \geq 50)\]</span> Before looking below, practice using Bayes’ theorem to write out that conditional probability in terms of other probabilities you may have.</p>
<p>We might use Bayes’ theorem in this situation if we are doing a case-control study, which would allow us to estimate <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50 | D = 1)\)</span> (i.e., the proportion of “old” people among the cases), and we already know the overall prevalence of disease (<span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1\)</span>)) and age distribution (specifically, <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50)\)</span>) in the population. Then we can combine these pieces of information to get <span class="math display">\[P(D = 1 | A \geq 50) = \frac{P(A \geq 50 | D = 1)P(D = 1)}{P(A \geq 50)}\]</span> Does this match what you wrote down?</p>
<p>As for finding these quantities using R, we can go about this a number of ways. We’ve already seen two ways to get <span class="math inline">\(P(D = 1)\)</span>, using the <code>prop.table()</code> and <code>table()</code> functions, or using the <code>mean()</code> function. Use both of these methods to find <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50)\)</span>.</p>

<pre class="text"><code>mean(dat$age &gt;= 50)
prop.table(table(dat$age &gt;= 50))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When we used the <code>mean()</code> function, what we were really calculating could be written out like this: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i \geq 50)\]</span> We’re summing up the number of people in the population whose age is greater or equal to 50, and dividing by the total number of people. Using that same idea, think about how we could find <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50 | D = 1)\)</span> before reading on.</p>
Whenever we have a conditioning statement like <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span> above, we’re looking in some subset of the population. That means that any fractions will have a different denominator: only those people for whom <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span>. So we might write <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50 | D = 1)\)</span> as a mean like this: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n_1}\sum_{i = 1}^{n_1} I(A_i \geq 50 \cap D = 1)\]</span> Now we are totaling the number of people whose age is greater or equal to 50 <em>and</em> have disease (recall that the intersection symbol <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> means that <em>both</em> events must happen), and we are dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, which I will define as the number of diseased people. One way we could get these numbers is from a 2-by-2 table:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="twobytwo" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<pre class="text"><code>addmargins(table(dat$age &gt;= 50, dat$disease))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"age-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>where 19 is the number over 50 and with disease (<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i = 1}^{n_1} I(A_i \geq 50 \cap D = 1)\)</span>) and 30 is the number of diseased people, our denominator <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>.</p>
Obviously we could have more easily calculated the proportion <span class="math inline">\(\frac{19}{30} = 0.63\)</span> using the <code>prop.table()</code> function. Recall that we need to use the <code>margin =</code> argument to find a conditional probability. Try it out below:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="agePropTable" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="1">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"center","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.timelimit":60,"exercise.setup":"age-prep","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>

<pre class="text"><code>prop.table(table(dat$age &gt;= 50, dat$disease), margin = 2)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Along with using tables, we could also use the <code>sum()</code> function to come up with the values 19 and 30. See if you can do so. Remember from the probability rules section how we can find the intersection <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> of two events.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ageSums" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="2">

<p>Finally, we could of course also calculate this conditional probability by using the <code>mean()</code> function only in the subset of the population for whom <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span>. You’ve already made that subsetted dataset. Confirm that <span class="math inline">\(P(A \geq 50| D = 1)\)</span> using this method as well.</p>

<h2>Quick detour into calculus</h2>
<p>Many classes on probability and statistics require multivariable calculus. That is certainly not a prerequisite for PHS 2000. However, a tiny bit of calculus will show up at some points during the year. You won’t need to solve complicated integrals or anything, just understanding the relationship between integrals and derivatives and what they can tell us about functions. We’ll review the concepts briefly here, but if you feel like you might need more review, check out the links below. (If you have never taken calculus, don’t run to sign up for a whole class. See if you can get what you need from this content and perhaps some of the links, and contact us if you have any questions or want more references.)</p>
<div id="section-derivatives" class="section level4">
<h4>Derivatives</h4>
<p>The basic idea of a derivative is that it describes the rate of change of a function. If the function we’re looking at is <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, then there are a couple of ways we usually notate the first derivative of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, which we’ll use interchangeably: <span class="math display">\[g&#39;(x) = \frac{d}{dx}g(x)\]</span> Both equivalently tell us that we are looking at the function <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> and taking the first derivative with respect to the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. That means that as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> changes, we want to know how much <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> changes. This is just the slope of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> at a given value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>As we can see above, when the first derivative is 0, the function may have reached a maximum. (This is the case if <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) &gt; 0\)</span> just prior to the value at which <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) = 0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) &lt; 0\)</span> just after. Confirm for yourself that this is true on the graph above.)</p>
<p>It also may have reached a minimum, as at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0.5\)</span> on the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/slope3-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This tells us that if we want to find the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that maximizes or minimizes a function, we can take its first derivative <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x)\)</span> and figure out where <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s find a maximum. If <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = -2x^2 + x - 3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) = - 4x + 1\)</span> (if you’re not sure how we got that, you can review the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-rules/ab-power-rule/v/power-rule">power rule</a>, but you won’t be asked to compute derivatives, only understand why you might do so).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s confirm by looking at the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/slope4-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Of course, without looking at the graph, we didn’t actually know whether the point at which <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(x) = 0\)</span> was a minimum or a maximum. We could differentiate again to check whether the second derivative was positive (a minimum) or negative (a maximum), but we don’t need to practice that (though you can if you want to!).</p>
<p>The important thing is that you understand that one way to maximize a function is to differentiate it. Specifically, the steps are: find the first derivative, set it to 0, and solve (then check the second derivative to confirm it’s a maximum).</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, functions are hard to differentiate or finding roots for their derivatives is difficult. In that case we may use other methods to maximize them. We won’t go into details, but imagine climbing the function above (<span class="math inline">\(g(x) = -2x^2 + x - 3\)</span>) like a hill. Every few steps you calculate the slope in the small area around you. If the slope is getting closer to 0 (getting flatter), you keep going forward; if you’re going downhill, you turn around and head back. You keep walking around and checking the slope around you, moving closer to where it’s exactly 0, until you’re at the top of the hill and you’ve maximized the function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-integrals" class="section level4">
<h4>Integrals</h4>
<p>Another way we might want to describe a function is by the area under its curve. Whereas the derivative gave us an idea of the instantaneous rate of change of a function, an integral tells us how much cumulative space a function is covering (in terms of distance from the x-axis) as x gets larger.</p>
<p>For example, in the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4\)</span> below, the area in blue is represented by the integral <span class="math display">\[\int_{-2}^{2} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx\]</span> <img src="index_files/figure-html/index-3-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The values at the top and bottom of the integral sign are those between which we’re computing the integral. We could integrate over the whole function, from <span class="math inline">\(- \infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, or choose other limits of integration:</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/index-4-1.png" width="624" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>If a function is non-negative, like the above function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4\)</span> is between <span class="math inline">\(x = -2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x = 3\)</span> (the function is always above the x-axis), then, if we set a constant lower limit, the integral increases with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. What this means is that <span class="math display">\[\int_{-2}^{-1} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx \leq \int_{-2}^{0} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx \leq\int_{-2}^{1} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx \leq \int_{-2}^{2} 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 \; dx\]</span> and so on. On the graph, the area under the curve can only accumulate area, so the integral evaluated at greater and greater upper limits can only increase.</p>

<h4>Fundamental theorem of calculus</h4>
<p>The fundamental theorem of calculus relates the two concepts of differentiation and integration. If we have a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> over the interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span>, we can define another function <span class="math display">\[F(x) = \int_a^x f(x) \; dx\]</span> What this means is that, for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span>, our new function <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> is the integral of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> from the beginning of that interval to the point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can then say that <span class="math display">\[f(x) = F&#39;(x)\]</span> That is, the function inside the integral is the first derivative of the function that was defined <em>as</em> the integral. In other words, derivatives and integrals work like inverse operations. We’ll see in the next section how this relationship helps us understand probability distributions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/taking-derivatives-calc">Here</a> is a <strong>lot</strong> of information about derivatives. You don’t need more than the first few videos.

Watch the video on antiderivatives and indefinite integrals from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/integral-calculus/indefinite-integrals">this</a> page and some of those on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/integral-calculus/fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-ic">this</a> page to understand the link between derivatives and integrals.</p>
